## Overview
This project implements a Morse Code Converter in Python. The converter takes input text in ASCII and translates it into Morse Code. It also supports the reverse operation, translating Morse Code into ASCII text.

## Features
- Converts ASCII text to Morse Code
- Converts Morse Code to ASCII text
- Supports letters, numbers, and common punctuation

## Usage
1. Run the `morse_code_converter.py` script.
2. Choose whether to convert ASCII to Morse Code or Morse Code to ASCII.
3. Enter the input text accordingly.
4. The converted result will be displayed.

## Implementation Details
- The converter uses dictionaries to map characters to Morse Code and vice versa.
- Handles both upper and lower case letters.
- Supports numbers and common punctuation.
- The user can choose the conversion direction.

## Dependencies

## Conclusions
To conclude, I would thank my instructor for being such a wonderful teacher for coming up with a beautiful course. I would like to thank MYSELF for being self-motivated throughout the lecture.
